# DeFi Liquidation Risk Modeling with Monte Carlo Simulation  
*A Quantitative Research Project using ETH and Compound V3 Parameters*  

---

## About This Repo and Me (https://github.com/codesport)

THIS REPO IS STILL IN DRAFT.  I STILL NEED TO MAP MATH EQUATIONS TO PYTHON CODE in the [Quantitative \& Financial Theory](#quantitative--financial-theory) 

This repository demonstrates the type of financial risk management work I do for clients at my current company.  In a nutshell, I apply traditional **quantitative finance techniques** to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) risk management.  

Using **Monte Carlo simulation** with **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**, I modeled the probability of liquidation for ETHâ€‘backed loans on **Compound V3 Optimism**

### About Me

## Takeaways

- **Collateral Size Drives Risk**
  - 10 ETH Collateral â†’ ~36% liquidation risk over 30 days  
  - 12.5 ETH Collateral â†’ ~5%  
  - 15 ETH Collateral â†’ <1%  

- **Compound V3 Risk Parameters**
  - **Borrow Limit (Collateral Factor)**: 83%  
  - **Liquidation Threshold**: 88%  
  - Borrowing close to the liquidation threshold sharply increases tail risk.  

- **Monte Carlo Simulation Results**
  - ~49% probability ETH touches **$3,000** in the next 30 days  
  - ~36% probability ETH touches **$4,000** in the same horizon  
  - Highlights the importance of hedging for *both downside and upside volatility*.

## Quantitative & Financial Theory

- **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**  


$$
S_{t+1} = S_t \cdot \exp\left((\mu - \tfrac{1}{2}\sigma^2)\Delta t + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t} \cdot Z\right), \quad Z \sim N(0,1)
$$

- **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**  
  $$
  LTV_t = \frac{\text{Loan USD}}{\text{Collateral Amount} \times S_t}
  $$ 
  - Liquidation occurs if:
   $$
   LTV_t \geq \text{liq\_factor}
   $$


- **Monte Carlo Simulation**  
  - Thousands of ETH price paths are generated to estimate the probability of hitting liquidation thresholds.  
  - Captures **path-dependent risk** often missed by static stress tests.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3**  
- **Pandas** for time series data  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization  
- **NumPy** for vectorized simulations  
- **CoinGecko API** for historical ETH data  

---

## Practical Applications

- **For Borrowers**: Understand the probability of liquidation over a chosen horizon.  
- **For Protocol Designers**: Calibrate **collateral factors** and **liquidation thresholds**.  
- **For Quant Traders**: Hedge against liquidation cascades and market stress events.

## Other Models: Sigmoid Curve<sup>4,5</sup> 

I do not use these in my work, but many protocols use them to assist with incentive design: 

- Token Supply Bonding Curves: Token Price vs Supply<sup>4,5</sup>
     $$
     Price(Supply) = \frac{L}{1 + e^{-k \cdot (Supply - x_{0})}}
     $$  

    Where:  
    - \(L\) = maximum (ceiling) price  
    - \(x_{0}\) = supply inflection point  
    - \(k\) = steepness of the curve  
  
- Borrowing rates
- Liquidation penalties
- Collateral factor adjustments
- Protocol Health:
    $$
    P(LTV) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-k \cdot (LTV - LTV_{0})}}
    $$
